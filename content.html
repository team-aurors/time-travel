                <p class="text-heading">Time Dilation</p>
                <p class="text-paragraph">Before Einstein told everyone about the Theory of Relativity everyone thought Time is absolute which means Time is same everywhere in the universe. But then Einstein told everyone that Time is relative which means Time is different everywhere in the universe. The more the gravitional force of the celestial body the more Time is slow. This is known as Time Dilation. You might think that this is all a lie. In the 1970's an experiment was done to prove this. They had 2 clocks. They put 1 clock in the aeroplane and 1 one in the Earth. The aeroplane moved very fast. After some Time when the aeroplane came back to Earth they saw that the clock in the aeroplane was slightly slow than the clock of the Earth. This proves Time Dilation.</p>

                <p class="text-paragraph">1. One-sided Time Travel means we can go to the past or the future but cannot come back. Shown in the movie Interstellar. 2. Instantaneous Time Travel means we can go to the past or the future and come back in a couple of seconds. Shown in the movie The Back to the Future. 3. Time moving around the traveller which means Time is moving around the traveller. Shown in the movie Harry Potter : Prisoner of Azkaban.4. Slow Time Travel which means we travel into the past or the future slowly. Shown in the movie Primer. 5. Travelling at the speed of light which means we travel at the speed of light. Shown in the movie Superman (1979).</p>

                <p class="text-paragraph">Believe it we can Time travel. We can Time travel into the future. 1. Speed of light means if we travel at the speed of light we can go to the future. You shall learn about light-years means the distance light travels in a year. Light's speed is 10<sup>8</sup>m/s. That means light-years = 3.1536e+15 m. IF we match the speed of light we can go to the other place and see the future. 2. Gravitional Field which means we can time travel with the help of gravity. If we go to the black holes and stay 3 hours near the black hole and return to Earth we will see that 21 years have passed. So, we can time travel to the future using gravitional field.</p>
